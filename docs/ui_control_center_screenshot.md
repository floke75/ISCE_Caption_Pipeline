# Control Center UI Screenshot

This document tracks the latest control center dashboard screenshot generated during automated PR review. The image itself is attached to the corresponding pull request run artifacts rather than stored in the repository to avoid bloating the repo size.

To reproduce the screenshot locally:

1. Install the lightweight API dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn pyyaml
   ```

2. Start the FastAPI server from the repository root:

   ```bash
   uvicorn ui.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. From another shell, capture the dashboard using Playwright (requires `playwright` to be installed and browsers set up):

   ```bash
   playwright install
   playwright screenshot http://127.0.0.1:8000 docs/control-center-ui.png
   ```

4. Commit the updated screenshot if a checked-in artifact is required.

The current PR run captured the UI and attached the image as `control-center-ui.png` in the workflow artifacts.


## Latest capture

- Screenshot artifact: `control-center-ui.png` (generated by Playwright during this run).
- Capture location: browser artifact `browser:/invocations/gcxuwdpx/artifacts/artifacts/control-center-ui.png`.
- Viewport: 1440x900 showing the inference workflow tab and live job monitor.

## UI tour

1. **Workflow tabs** – Switch between inference, training pair generation, model training, and configuration editors from a single navigation bar.
2. **Inference launch form** – Collects media, optional transcript, and override inputs with validated pickers and config editors to start a job.
3. **Queue-aware job monitor** – Streams live progress, log access, and artifact links for active and historical jobs.
4. **Configuration editors** – Provide YAML-backed editing for pipeline and model settings with validation before persisting changes.

### Workflow tabs

The tab strip at the top of the workspace flips between the four job types. Each tab updates the primary form without navigating away, so operators can launch different tasks in succession while a shared job monitor stays pinned on the right.

### Inference launch form

The highlighted inference panel accepts a media file, an optional transcript, and destination paths via validated path pickers that query the server. Advanced users can expand the overrides editor to tweak pipeline or model parameters before submitting the job, and the queue indicator shows where the request will land in the worker pool.

### Job monitor

The sidebar lists pending and finished jobs with progress bars, status chips, and quick actions. Selecting a job streams live logs over Server-Sent Events and exposes artifact download links once each step completes.

### Configuration editors

Pipeline and model configuration cards render the underlying YAML with conflict-safe editing controls. Changes are validated on the server so partial saves or invalid syntax never overwrite the active settings.
